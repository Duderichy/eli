Version %%VERSION%% of the emacs-lisp interface is now ready for use.
This status of this version working with various versions of emacs is:

* GNU Emacs 19.34

    No known problems.

* GNU Emacs 20.2

    Works, but a bug in the handling of `load-file-name' prevents
    loading the interface the normal way, by just loading
    "fi-site-init.el".  You must put the directory which contains
    fi-site-init.el in your `load-path'.  See examples/emacs.el for an
    example of how to do this.  The bug should be fixed in GNU Emacs
    20.3, when it comes out.

* XEmacs 19.16

    No known problems.

* XEmacs 20.3

    No known problems.

You may ftp this new version from:

	ftp://ftp.franz.com/pri/acl/eli/%%TGZFILE%%

then

	gzip -d < %%TGZFILE%% | tar xf -

to create %%DIR%% in the directory where the above command is
executed.

To use the interface, just load

	%%DIR%%/fi-site-init

in your ~/.emacs.
