Lots of entries not added to this file, since they went straight to
eli.htm in the post-6.2 eli hacking I did... the ones here have not
been added to eli.htm:

1. bug8475: Properly handle non-ASCII characters in the communication
between Emacs/MULE and Lisp. 

2. bug8953: Fix some errors which happened when Lisp and Emacs
communicated filenames.

3. bug8801: symbol completion now works when excl:*print-nickname*
non-nil.

4. bug7874: symbol completion of keywords, and other obscure
completion problems have been fixed.

5. rfe5678: change emacs-lisp rendezvous on windows to be more like
*NIX.  This has two important/significant benefits to Windows users:
   a. multiple instances of emacs/lisp pairings are now possible
   b. by specifying a remote host name to fi:common-lisp, you can run
      a lisp on *NIX with within an Emacs on Windows.  This requires
      an rsh.exe, but NT/2k/XP has a native version.  Cygwin can be
      used if rsh.exe is not already available.

6. rfe5674: the correct file position and name now appear in
the popup buffer for incremental compiler warnings.

7. bug8802: On Windows, SHELL is unset before running Lisp, since the
version used by Emacs on NT/2k does not work well with
run-shell-command.

8. rfe4337: new variable fi:user-env-vars.

9. rfe5597: resizing the Emacs frame causes the pretty printer to
notice the change in width and behave accordingly.

10. rfe4040: for buffers in binary mode, finding character positions
now works properly.

11. rfe2463: handle multiple in-package's in a file when doing
evaluations of forms and definitions.

12. rfe4814: indentation of forms when element after opening paren is
#+/#- pair are now handled like this:

(#-blah no-blah
 #+blah yes-blah
 (blah blah blah)
 t)

instead of like this:

(#-blah no-blah
        #+blah yes-blah
        (blah blah blah)
        t)
